    In this game, each player simultaneously pressing a button representing rock, paper, or scissors.
    The winner is determined by a set of rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.
    To make the game more interactive, we included a frontend interface that allows players to make their moves and see the result of the game.
    The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The backend is built using a server-side API, client-side application, and game logic.
    The server-side API would be a restful API that exposes endpoints to start a new game, make a move, and get the current game state.
    The API would handle requests and responses in JSON format. Client-side application would be a web application that consumes the REST API to play the game.
    The application would display the game state, allow the user to make a move, and show the results of each round. Game logic would be implemented by server-side API for rock-paper-scissors.
    The application would display the game state, allow the user to make a move, and show the results of each round.
    Game logic would be implemented by server-side API for rock-paper-scissors.
    The API would receive the moves made by both the user and the computer, determine the winner of each round, and update the game state accordingly.
    We have a chat server beside out rock paper scissors game which allows the player to communicate between each other. The user first need to enter their usernames
    and then after can text between each other.
